# SUPERVISED ANOMALY DETECTION

Anomaly detection has 3 parts. In this project I examined supervised learning anomaly detection. This is actually a classification problem. But there are some difference like used metrics(mahalanobis distance instead of eucledian distance)[1]. Or unbalanced data. But because of this dataset has a balanced dataset, I didn't touch those problems. There are 3 steps in this project: exploratory data analysis, feature engineering and modelling. I implemented 9 models(Logistic Regression, Stochastic Gradient Descent Classifier, Passive-Aggressive Algorithms, LightGBM, Extra Trees, Neural Networks, KNN, Naive Bayes and XGBOD(XGBClassifier from PyOD))
